# Jadbus

A DBus daemon for Windows, Mac OS and optionally Linux. While based on dbus-java, it is natively compiled and has a low
memory footprint and fast start-up, at least compared to when execute with a full runtime.  

*Linux of course already has it's own dbus broker. It is included here for demonstration purposes, and can co-exist with
Jadbus*
